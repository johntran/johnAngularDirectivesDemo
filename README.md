I built this demo to show how much I know about Angular directives.

I apologize for not making folders. I built this demo in a day.

Thank you for your time! Please feel free to open issues!

Plunker to play with demo: http://plnkr.co/edit/nkRxMS

Star Wars Demo implements:
 * Component Directives
 * Templates
 * Controllers in Directives
 * Using '@' to bind directive scope by DOM Attribute. Used for literal strings.
 * Using '=' to bind directive scope to parent scope. Used for objects.
 * Using '&' to bind directive scope to a function. Used to pass functions.
 * Inherited Scope: See 'collapsed' variable for userInfoCard and address.
 * Decorative Directive: State Display, allows to change colors based on parameters given.



Decorative Directive implementation:
* Video Demo: Adding pause/play on spacebar.
* John Click Demo: Re-implements ng-click.
* User Tile Demo: Business-specific decorator.
* Watch Demo: Creating my own watch.

Will implement later this week:
* Transclusion
* Nested Directives
* Modal Directive
